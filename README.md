# UniCloudlib
UniCloudlib, created by Jk7 and Chidinma, simplifies access to academic resources for university students. Inspired by our own struggles, it organizes materials by school and department. Senior students and lecturers share helpful files and lecture notes, fostering a collaborative community where students easily access essential resources.
